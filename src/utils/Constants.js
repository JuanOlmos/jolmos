  'I am a PhD student in Computer Science, jointly enrolled at UIS and IP-Paris. My research is conducted within the "Biomedical, Imaging, Vision, and Learning Laboratory" (BIVL2AB) at UIS and part-time at "L\'unité d\'Informatique et d\'Ingénierie des Systèmes" (U2IS) at ENSTA, IP-Paris. \n\nI hold a Master’s degree in Applied Mathematics and a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics. My research primarily focuses on modeling data within Riemannian Manifolds. I specialize in developing compact descriptors for data representation and designing learning schemes to differentiate data within these geometric spaces. \n\nI have applied these techniques to action recognition problems and, more recently, to biomedical challenges. For example, I have quantified Parkinsonian patterns by analyzing eye fixation and gait. Currently, my research interests include characterizing prostate cancer lesions using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).';
